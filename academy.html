            structure, as well as oceanographic engineering, oceanic engineering or nautical engineering. Specifically,
            marine engineering is the discipline of applying engineering sciences, including mechanical engineering,
            electrical engineering, electronic engineering, and computer science, to the development,   and propulsion plants, machinery, piping, automation and control systems for marine
            vehicles of any kind, such as surface ships and submarines<span id='dots'>...</span><span id='more'>The

                The present MES Program Educational Objectives are to provide young men and women with the professional
                education and training that will prepare them to:<br><br>

                1. Serve as a licensed engineering officer in the United States Merchant Marine, with the ability to
                advance to Chief Engineer position.<br>
                2. Serve in a variety of professional engineering positions in the maritime-related shore side industry,
                with the capability to rise to senior positions.<br>
                3. Have particular skills in the analysis and design of marine propulsion, auxiliary and cargo systems
                and equipment, preparing them to apply these skills to a variety of marine applications.<br>
                4. Pursue graduate study in engineering and/or become licensed as a Professional Engineer, should they
                so choose.<br><br>

                An important element of the Marine Engineering Systems Program is the design experience interwoven
                throughout a student’s four years, culminating in the capstone design project in senior year. The
                student participates as part of a design team tasked with developing a specific group of systems that
                make up a complete power plant design for the project ship. The project is spread over three terms and
                finishes with a presentation of the final design to a panel of faculty and invited industry
                professionals. The Marine Engineering Systems Program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation
                Commission (EAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).<br>
