  <div id="Washington DC" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>1. Washington DC</h3>
    <p id='pw'>Washington (/ˈwɒʃɪŋtən/ (About this soundlisten)), officially the State of Washington, is a state in the Pacific
      Northwest region of the United States. Named for George Washington, the first U.S. president, the state was made
      out of the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British Empire in 1846, in accordance
      with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute.<br> The state, which is bordered on the
      west by the Pacific Ocean, Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and the Canadian province of British Columbia
      to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital; the state's
      largest city is Seattle. Washington is often referred to as Washington state to distinguish it from the nation's
      capital, Washington, D.C.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="California" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>2. California</h3>
    <p>California is a state on the west coast of the United States. With over 39.3 million residents across a total
      area of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), it is the most populous and the third-largest U.S. state
      by area. It is also the most populated subnational entity in North America and the 34th most populous in the
      world. The Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second and fifth most populous
      urban regions respectively, with the former having more than 18.7 million residents and the latter having over 9.6
      million.<br> Sacramento is the state's capital, while Los Angeles is the most populous city in the state and the
      second most populous city in the country (after New York City). Los Angeles County is the country's most populous,
      while San Bernardino County is the largest county by area in the country. San Francisco, which is both a city and
      county, is the second most densely populated major city in the country (after New York City) and the fifth most
      densely populated county in the country, behind four of New York City's five boroughs.</p>

  <div id="Arizona" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>3. Arizona</h3>
    <p>Arizona (/ˌærɪˈzoʊnə/ (About this soundlisten) ARR-iz-OH-nə; Navajo: Hoozdo Hahoodzo Navajo pronunciation:
      [hoː˥zto˩ ha˩hoː˩tso˩]; O'odham: Alĭ ṣonak) is a state in the Southwestern region of the United States. It is also
      usually considered part of the Mountain states. It is the 6th largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states.
      Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona shares the Four Corners region with Utah, Colorado, and New
      Mexico; its other neighboring states are Nevada and California to the west and the Mexican states of Sonora and
      Baja California to the south and southwest.<br>

      Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood on
      February 14, 1912. Historically part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain, it became part of
      independent Mexico in 1821. After being defeated in the Mexican–American War, Mexico ceded much of this territory
      to the United States in 1848. The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden
      Purchase.</p>

  <div id="Georgia" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>4. Georgia</h3>
    <p>Georgia (/ˈdʒɔːrdʒə/) is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States, bordered to the north by
      Tennessee and North Carolina; to the northeast by South Carolina; to the southeast by the Atlantic Ocean; to the
      south by Florida; and to the west by Alabama. Georgia is the 24th-largest in area and 8th-most populous of the 50
      United States. Its 2019 estimated population was 10,617,423, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.[4] Atlanta, a
      "beta(+)" global city, is both the state's capital and its largest city. The Atlanta metropolitan area, with an
      estimated population of more than 6 million people in 2019,[5] is the 9th most populous metropolitan area in the
      United States and contains about 57% of Georgia's entire population. <br>

      Founded in 1733 as a British colony, Georgia was the last and southernmost of the original Thirteen Colonies to be
      established.[6] Named after King George II of Great Britain, the Colony of Georgia covered the area from South
      Carolina south to Spanish Florida and west to French Louisiana at the Mississippi River.</p>

  <div id="Texas" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>5. Texas</h3>
    <p>Texas (/ˈtɛksəs/, also locally /ˈtɛksɪz/) is a state in the South Central region of the United States. It is the
      second largest U.S. state by both area (after Alaska) and population (after California). Texas shares borders with
      the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and
      the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and southwest, and has a
      coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast.<br>

      Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth largest in the U.S., while San Antonio is the
      second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. Dallas–Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the
      fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country, respectively. Other major cities include
      Austin, the second-most populous state capital in the U.S., and El Paso. Texas is nicknamed the "Lone Star State"
      for its former status as an independent republic, and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from
      Mexico. The "Lone Star" can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal. The origin of Texas's
      name is from the word táyshaʼ, which means "friends" in the Caddo language.</p>
